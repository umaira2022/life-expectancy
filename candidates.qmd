Using data from over 1,000 candidates for governor in the United States since 1945, we aim to develop a model that estimates how age at election may relate to post-election longevity. However, since our data is limited to gubernatorial candidates, the modelâ€™s predictions may not generalize well to individuals running for other political offices or in different contexts.

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.
